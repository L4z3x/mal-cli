=> result:
    - scroll trough the results 
    - click p for next page pagination (not next route ?) 

=> ui problems:
    - search bar is no aligned with the side menujamais
    - side menu box's elements are not responsive
    - result cards navigation fix

=> keys bar:
    - keys bar for each display_block

=> general:
    - image cache clearing (LAST USED) ( WITH A JSON FILE ig)
    -  exit verification
    - make 'q' return the user to the home screen and close the popup if there is one 
    - cleaning the codebase
    - change demo video to a gif

=> detail page:
    - [x] add IoEvent to post the edit (for each button)

        - we need to find a good approach to handle displaying the data after the edit 
        - first we display "loading" in the popup 
        - then just overwrite the UserAnimeListStatus struct with the result 
        - otherwise we ll display a error message in the popup
        - add delete instead of "add" in the add_to_list popup (status)
=> bug:
    - on ranking page col 1 row 2 , handlers/mod.rs 174
    - stuck on loading, there is something ambigious that keeps the network thread busy, we neeed to figure out what it is.
